## Arbitrary Table 
In this folder one can find examples on how to write arbitary table for the given desc file "lookup_3dep_4indep.desc" for 3 dependent and 4 independent varialbels.
The code given in Fortran and C++ gives the same output files "lookup_3dep_4indep_cpp.bin" and "lookup_3dep_4indep_fortran.bin". The size of each is 302940 bytes.

* To run the fortran code: bash run_f.sh
* To run the C++ code: bash run_c.sh 
* To check the output: bash run_check.sh | less
